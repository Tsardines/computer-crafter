# computer-crafter

#### Conception and Inspiration
I've decided to create a variation of the popular computer building website, PC Part Picker, and turn it into a minimalistic but easy-to-use app.

When researching project ideas I came across a similar site that a GA alum built, using Express and Node, and I realized that making my own version was definitely a possibility. But unlike their project, mine will be built with Rails, primarily due to the ease of building components, the backend, and user auth.

#### MVP
This project's MVP is as follows:
  -

- post-mvp


- landing page


- individual part pages


- register/login


- profile


- the list itself




- possible complications


- technologies
