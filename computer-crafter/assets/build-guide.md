##### Build Guide

_"A computer built is a computer worth having" - Me_

Congratulations! You've taken your first step toward computer independence. Thanks, Family Member, for buying my first PC to get me started all those years ago.

The real techies out there don't _buy_ their computers anymore...unless you're a laptop kind of person. We build ours. Building a computer is more than just assembling a bunch of parts and hoping that they fit. Rather than throwing your hard-earned money right at the screen, you need to have a game plan in order to get the general assembly right.

Below is a useful list of important definitions so you can know just what the hell you're doing.

##### Motherboard
A printed circuit board (PCB) that allows all of your components and external peripherals to connect and communicate with one another. Motherboards have a _form factor_, which is an industry standard method to determine their dimensions. The most common standards (in order of size) are ATX, Micro-ATX, and the super small Mini-ITX.

##### CPU (central processing unit)
Processes data and produces output, which may be stored by an application or displayed onscreen. A CPU contains at least one processor, which is the actual chip inside the CPU that performs calculations. Nowadays, it's common for a computer to have at least two processors (or "processing cores") for stronger performance.

##### CPU Cooler
The CPU itself may run hot, which is where a CPU cooler would come into play. Essentially, it's built to draw heat away from the CPU and lower its temperature, thus improving its efficiency and stability. There are several types of coolers, the first being an air cooler and the second a liquid cooler.

An _air cooler_ contains a heat sink that disperses heat that's coming from the top of the CPU. It's limited by heat density, in that it can't properly cool a small and overheated component. Air cooling's best for components that have a larger surface area. It's important to note that in the long run, heat density can be permanently damaging for electrical components and can lead to a shorter lifespan, loss of data, and system crashes.

_Liquid cooling_ circulates liquid through small pipes in a heat sink, drawing heat away from the CPU to a radiator located on the system case or enclosure. Eventually it's released into the air outside the system, and the cooled liquid cycles back through the system and back to the CPU. Water has a higher thermal conductivity than air, and allows liquid systems to run at quieter noise levels than their air-y counterparts.

##### RAM
Also known as _"random access memory"_, it allows info. to be stored and retrieved on a computer. Information is accessed randomly (instead of sequentially like a CD or hard drive), which allows a computer to access the data much faster.

RAM is inserted into a computer's motherboard and housed in a _memory/RAM slot._ A motherboard determines the number of memory slots available (typically two to four) as well as the type of RAM that the computer requires.

The current memory standard is DDR4 DIMM 288-pin, with "DIMM" indicating that its format is desktop memory. The format for laptops is called SO-DIMM, which will not function with a full-sized DIMM motherboard.

##### GPU
A programmable logic chip (processor) that renders images, animations, and video for the computer's screen. A GPU is not just used for 2D data, such as zooming and panning the screen, but it's essential for the smooth decoding and rendering of 3D animations and video. The higher quality the GPU, the faster and smoother a game/movie's motion will be.

##### Storage
The _hard disk drive_ is the solution for mass storage. It stores data magnetically on a circular "hard disk", anywhere from 128 gigabytes to 10 terabytes (and beyond). There are three things to consider when buying a HDD: speed, capacity, and physical size (there are two sizes for HDDs: 2.5" and 3.5").

While a _solid state drive_ tends to have limited storage compared to a HDD, don't be fooled. One of its main features is extremely fast read/write speeds, which is ideal for storing your main applications and your operating system (yes, it's possible to boot up your computer in less than fifteen seconds).

Having one of each drive is highly recommended. But take note: A HDD has more storage space and is pretty affordable, while a SSD is lightning fast but generally more expensive.

##### Power Supply
The PSU converts the wall socket's 100V-240V current into clean DC current and supplies it to your components.

Because the PSU is the first place that your computer receives electricity, it's the most vulnerable to power surges. As such, it is highly recommend to do your research on power supplies and buy one with excellent user feedback and reviews. Buy nice, not twice.

##### Case
The case protects your components from outside hazards: dust, cat dander, wandering fingers, and more.

Here are some things to consider when buying your first case:

_form factor_ - Your case must be physically compatible with your motherboard.

_airflow_ - Take careful consideration of the number of fans included with your case. More fans = better flow.

_cable management_ - Cable management is the subtle art of turning a spaghetti mess of cables into a clean, working setup that you'd be proud to show off. Some cases are better at dealing with cable management than others, such as having slots in the back to house your ugly cables.

_window_ - A side panel that allows you to view your computer components without having to rip the whole thing apart. Important to note, some side panel cases can add to the noise level.

_material type_ - Cheaper cases tend to be made out of plastic, and more expensive ones can be made partly or entirely out of metal.

_bays and mount points_ - Most cases have three bay sizes: 2.5", 3.5", and 5.25". The 2.5" bay can house SSDs and laptop hard drives, the 3.5" is mainly for desktop HDDs, and the 5.25" bays can hold just about anything.

##### Monitor
Don't underestimate the importance of a monitor...it can make or break your computer experience. A monitor plugs into video outputs on your motherboard or your GPU.

_resolution_ - The number and density of the pixels that are on the monitor. The most common ones today include: 1920x1080, 2560x1440, and 3840x2160---they're always referred to 1080p, 1440p (2K), and 4K, respectively. The higher the resolution, the sharper the image will be. But be warned: a higher resolution will require a significantly more powerful GPU to achieve the same frame rate as a 1080p monitor.

_refresh rate_ - The number of times a monitor refreshes every second, that's calculated in hertz (Hz). Whenever a monitor's used it's constantly updating the screen with new, static images.

_panel type_ - Most computers are LED-backlit displays, but different LCD panel types exist, with the most common being TN and IPS. TN: lower response time, lower lag, and less expensive. IPS: better color accuracy, a wider viewing angle that doesn't distort color.
