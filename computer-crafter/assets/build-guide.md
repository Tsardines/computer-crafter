_"A computer built is a computer worth having" - Me_

Congratulations! You've taken your first step toward computer independence. Thanks, Family Member, for buying me my first PC to get me started all those years ago.

The real techies out there don't _buy_ their computers anymore...unless you're a laptop kind of person. We build ours. Building a computer is more than just assembling a bunch of parts and hoping that they fit. Rather than throwing your hard-earned money right at the screen, you need to have a game plan in order to get the general assembly right.

Below is a useful list of concise definitions so you can know just what the hell you're doing.

##### Motherboard
A printed circuit board (PCB) that allows all components and external peripherals to connect and communicate with one another. Motherboards have a _form factor_, which is an industry standard method to determine their dimensions. The most common standards (in order of size) are ATX, Micro-ATX, and the super small Mini-ITX.

##### CPU (central processing unit)
Processes data and produces output, which may be stored by an application or displayed onscreen. A CPU contains at least one processor, which is the actual chip inside the CPU that performs calculations. Nowadays, it's common for a computer to have at least two processors (or "processing cores") for stronger performance.

##### CPU Cooler
The CPU itself may run hot, which is where a CPU cooler would come into play. Essentially, it's built to draw heat away from the CPU and lower its temperature, thus improving its efficiency and stability. There are several types of coolers, the first being an air cooler and the second a liquid cooler.

An _air cooler_ contains a heat sink that disperses heat that's coming from the top of the CPU. It's limited by heat density, in that it can't properly cool a small and overheated component. Air cooling's best for components that have a larger surface area. It's important to note that in the long run, heat density can be permanently damaging for electrical components and can lead to a shorter lifespan, loss of data, and system crashes.

_Liquid cooling_ circulates liquid through small pipes in a heat sink, drawing heat away from the CPU to a radiator located on the system case or enclosure. Eventually it's released into the air outside the system, and the cooled liquid cycles back through the system and back to the CPU. Water has a higher thermal conductivity than air, and allows liquid systems to run at quieter noise levels than their air-y counterparts.

##### RAM
Also known as _"random access memory"_, it allows info. to be stored and retrieved on a computer. Information is accessed randomly (instead of sequentially like a CD or hard drive), which allows a computer to access the data much faster.

RAM is inserted into a computer's motherboard and housed in a _memory/RAM slot._ A motherboard determines the number of memory slots available (typically two to four) as well as the type of RAM that the computer requires.

The current memory standard is DDR4 DIMM 288-pin, with "DIMM" indicating that its format is desktop memory. The format for laptops is called SO-DIMM, which would not function with a full-sized DIMM motherboard.

##### Video/Graphics Card


##### Storage
The _hard disk drive_ is the solution for mass storage. It stores data magnetically on a circular "hard disk", anywhere from 128 gigabytes to 10 terabytes (and beyond). There are three things to consider when buying a HDD: speed, capacity, and physical size (there are two sizes for HDDs: 2.5" and 3.5").

While a _solid state drive_ tends to have limited storage compared to a HDD, don't be fooled. One of its main features is extremely fast read/write speeds, which is ideal for storing your main applications and your operating system (yes, it's possible to boot up your computer in less than fifteen seconds).

Having one of each drive is highly recommended. But take note: A HDD has more storage space and is pretty affordable, while a SSD is lightning fast but generally more expensive.
